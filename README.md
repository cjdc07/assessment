# Juul Assessment Submission

To run, open `index.html` in Chrome, Firefox, or Safari (might work on other browsers but was not able to test it).

A `Choose File` button will appear on the browser. Upload the `xmlTest.txt` file included here (this version of the file was validated and syntax errors were corrected). 

Uploading the file will generate the order form. The fields implement the validations described in the instructions. Clicking on next without following the format or not filling out required fields will prevent a user from submitting the form.

Once submitted, the app will navigate to a confirmation page where the data inputted by the user will be displayed.
